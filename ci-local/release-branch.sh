# Emulates ../Jenkinsfile's behavior for a `release*` build (e.g.
# `release-1.0.0`).
#
# Branch-gated stages that actually run, per the Jenkinsfile's `when`
# conditions (all keyed off `env.BRANCH_NAME.startsWith('release')`):
# Deploy/dev, Deploy/test, Deploy/prelive.
#
# Notably absent, and this is a faithful reproduction of the Jenkinsfile's
# actual logic, not a bug in this emulation: release* does NOT publish.
# Publish/Release requires `branch 'master'` exactly and Publish/Snapshot
# requires `startsWith('devel')` - a `release*` branch name matches
# neither `when` condition, so the Publish stage produces nothing on
# release* in real Jenkins either. Deploy/live and Tag are both
# `master`-only too, so neither runs here.
