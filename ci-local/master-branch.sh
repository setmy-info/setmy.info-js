# Emulates ../Jenkinsfile's behavior for a `master` build.
#
# Branch-gated stages that actually run on master, per the Jenkinsfile's
# `when` conditions (Publish/Release: `branch 'master'`; Deploy/live:
# `env.MASTER_TO_LIVE == 'DEPLOY' && env.BRANCH_NAME == 'master'`; Tag:
# `branch 'master' && env.MASTER_TO_LIVE == 'DEPLOY'`): Publish/Release,
# Deploy/live, Tag. master does NOT match Deploy/dev, Deploy/test, or
# Deploy/prelive's `when` conditions (all three require a `devel*` or
# `release*` branch name), so none of those run here - same as Jenkins.
#
# Nothing here sets PUBLISH_EXECUTE=true, so `npm run publish` always
# stays --dry-run, same as every other case script and the real CI files.
