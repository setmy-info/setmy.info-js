# does not start with `release`.
#
# None of the Publish/Deploy/Tag `when` conditions match a branch name
# like this, so none of those stages run - a developer gets full
# Inspection through Package build/lint/test/quality feedback and nothing
# else, exactly matching the Jenkinsfile's own comment: "a developer on a
# feature branch gets the same build, lint, test and quality feedback as
# devel/release/master, without ever reaching the Publish/Deploy/Tag
# stages below."
